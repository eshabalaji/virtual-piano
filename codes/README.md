In the Virtual Piano JFrame, the interface is crafted with various components such as buttons, radio buttons, and lists, all integrated to provide a rich user experience. Each piano key is represented by a button, spanning across 8 octaves, allowing users to explore a full range of musical notes. As users interact with the piano, the selected keys are dynamically displayed in a text field, enabling them to easily view and track the notes they play. Additionally, users can display the notes of a song and seamlessly play it, making the piano both an educational and creative tool for music enthusiasts of all levels.<br>
